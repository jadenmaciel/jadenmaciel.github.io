# Lockfile note:
# If you want reproducible builds, you can choose to allow package-lock.json.
# For now we ignore the lockfile at the OUTER level to avoid committing the accidental root init.
# The inner app's lockfile (wesleys-cpy/package-lock.json) SHOULD be committed.
# So we selectively allow that:
